# Project Statement – Banking Management System

## Problem Statement

Managing small-scale customer banking operations manually is error-prone and time-consuming. There is a need for a simple software tool that can handle basic banking activities like creating accounts, checking balances, depositing money, and withdrawing money through a structured interface.

## Scope of the Project

The project focuses on a single-user, console-based application that runs on a local machine. It covers only fundamental banking operations during one program session and does not include persistent storage, online access, or advanced banking products.

## Target Users

- Students learning basic programming and problem solving.
- Small demonstrations for teaching fundamental banking operations.
- Beginners who want to understand how to translate real-world processes into code.

## High-Level Features

- Creation of new customer accounts with essential details.
- Menu-based interaction for different banking options.
- Deposit and withdrawal operations with basic validation.
- Display of account details and balance to the user.
- Simple and readable code structure for educational purposes.
